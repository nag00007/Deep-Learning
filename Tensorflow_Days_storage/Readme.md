You are given "Days Storage.csv". In this data you are having 5 columns.
1. Days
2. Margin
3. Cost
4. Rev
5. GM (Gross Margin)
From the following you need to build the simple linear regression model in tensorflow with
"Days" as input and "GM" as output
Model Equation: GM = a + b * Days.


Task:
1. LOAD THE DATA IN GOOGLE COLAB AND IMPORT ALL NECESSARY CONNECTION
2. DRAW SCATTER PLOT BETWEEN DAYS AND GM 
3. CONSIDER X = DAYS, Y = GM
4. BUILD LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL TENSORFLOW WITH
  CONFIGURATION BELOW:
   * A. MODEL-1:
     * I. LOSS: MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR
     * II. OPTIMIZER: STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT
     * III. SET GOOD LEARNING RATE
   * B. MODEL-2:
     * I. LOSS: MEAN SQUARE ERROR
     * II. OPTIMIZER: ADAM OPTIMIZER
VISUALIZE SCALARS AND GRAPHS TENSORBOARD
5. VISUALIZE LOSS FOR TWO MODELS 
6. PRINT WEIGHTS FOR TWO MODELS 
7. DO MODEL EVALUATION
  * A. R SQUARE
  * B. RESIDUAL ANALYSIS
8. NEAT CODE PRESENTATION (WITH COMMENTS AND ORDER)
