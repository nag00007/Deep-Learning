# Bank Loan Term Deposit Sales

The data is from direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing
campaigns were based on phone calls. The classification goal is to predict if the customer will
subscribe to a term deposit (variable y). Often, more than one contact to the same customer was
required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for subscription.
